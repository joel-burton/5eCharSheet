Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting in position so it's impossible to track which image is real. \n Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spells duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets on of your duplicates. \n If you have 3 duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With 2 duplicates, an 8 or higher; with 1 duplicates, an 11 or higher. \n A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can only be destroyed by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed. \n A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can percieve illusions as false, as with truesight.`,

    notes: `Orphaned as a child. I spent my childhood on the streets of the cities, living homeless, and getting by mostly by staying out of the way. I was never a big kid, so I ran from most fights or stayed out of them entirely by sneaking around, and pilfering food to scrape by. When I was 12 I was taken in by a kindly cleric of Selune, a goddess of the moon. While most people saw me as a demon or an abberation, the priest saw me as something else- a likeness of their goddess, kind and caring, something to be valued, not tossed aside. The priest taught me the ways of their goddess- to value life, to be good, to not carelessly destroy life. \n\nWhile with that cleric I was taught the ways of Selune and her followers. Eventually the sorcerous blood began to show through more and more, and I became too much of a liability to stay in the town any longer, and from there I set out on my own again with the teaching of Selune to guide me.`
